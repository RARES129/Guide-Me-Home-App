# Guide-Me-Home
Guide Me Home is an application for those who suffer from topographic disorientation, in most cases people suf-
fering from Alzheimerâ€™s. This application offers pre-established routes to users, with which they can navigate to the
most frequently visited locations. In case of deviation from the route, the location is sent live to the assistants asso-
ciated with the user account, along with push and email notifications. The application was made with Spring Boot,
React.js and the Capacitor library that helped create the application in mobile format, Firebase as a database and Fire-
base Cloud Notification for the push notification service.
